A Digitalisation effort to make khasi-khasi dictionary available online.
### **<a href="http://localhost:8080/khasidict">Go to Dictionary</a>**

### How was it done? 

OCR tool was utilised to recognise the characters in the dictionary, then python scripts were used to convert the OCR output to readable line-by-line output. excel sheets were produced using latter output and then they were manually edited. Finally a xml document with 8400+ word entries was created.

### What it delivers?

* considerable accuracy with diacrities. 
* large collection of words.
* searchability

### What is it's source?

This online khasi dictionary was created using the book- Ka Dienshonhi(A Khasi-Khasi Dictionary) by Iarington Kharkongngor, available in internet archives.

### Where to find project resources?

Files and processes used for this dictionary are available in this **<a href="https://github.com/udaycruise2903/khasi-dienshonhi">Github</a>** link.

### How can you help?
OCR is not totally accurate. contributions to edit spelling and word errors in the dictionary improves quality of the work. Drop us a message to contribute.
