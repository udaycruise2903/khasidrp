A Digitalisation effort to make khasi-khasi dictionary available online.
### **<a href="http://localhost:8080/khasidict">Go to Dictionary</a>**

## How was it done? 

OCR tool was utilised to recognise the characters in the dictionary, then python scripts were used to convert the OCR output to readable line-by-line output. excel sheets were produced using latter output and then they were manually edited. Finally a xml document with 8400+ word entries was created.

## What it delivers?

* considerable accuracy with diacrities. 
* large collection of words.
* searchability

## How can you help?
OCR is not totally accurate. contributions to edit spelling and word errors in the dictionary improves quality of the work. Drop us a message to contribute.
